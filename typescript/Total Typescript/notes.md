# Typescript

## The implicit 'Any' Type error

```javascript
export const addTwoNumbers = (a: number, b: number) => {
  return a + b;
};
```
TypeScript relies on type annotations to understand the contracts the function must meet. Type annotations are critical to understanding TypeScript.

Whenever you create a function, you must always specify the types of each argument!

## Working with Object Params

Perhaps the simplest solution is to pass an object type directly to the params argument.

Use curly braces to represent the object, then create type inline:

```javascript
export const addTwoNumbers = (params: {first: number; second: number}) => {
  return params.first + params.second;
};
```
A useful technique is creating a named type. Use the type keyword, then provide a name and object similar to the previous solution.

In this case, we'll name the type AddTowNumbersArgs and type first and second as number:

``` javascript
type NewType = {
    first: number;
    second: number;
}
export const addTwoNumbers = (params: NewType) => 
  return params.first + params.second;
```
Interfaces can be used to represent objects (they can do other things, but we're only concerned with objects for now).

Using interface is similar to using type.

``` javascript
interface AddTwoNumbersArgs {
  first: number;
  second: number;
}

export const addTwoNumbers = (params: AddTwoNumbersArgs) => {
  return params.first + params.second;
};
```

generally speaking, you should be using aliases instead of going inline.

So when should you choose type and when should you choose interface?

It comes down to the syntax you prefer.

Technically, type can represent anything. It could be a number, or a string, or a boolean.

TypeScript will give you an error if you try to use a string with interface:

// this won't work! interface AddTwoNumbersArgs = string
// this won't work!

interface AddTwoNumbersArgs = string
When you're just getting started, it doesn't really matter if you choose type or interface.

Just be consistent!

## Set properties as optional

Adding a ? before the colon tells TypeScript that the property isn't required in order for the function to work.

``` javascript

export const getName = (params: { first: string; last?: string }) => {
```


Adding ? will also work when using named types, or anywhere else object keys can be specified.

type Params = { first: string; last?: string; }
type Params = {
  first: string;
  last?: string;
}
Tooling in VS Code is smart enough to recognize if a key is optional. This can be seen in the autocomplete, where you will be reminded that last should be either a string or undefined.

If you have prior experience with TypeScript, you might have seen a type explicitly set to string or undefined as seen below:

type Params = { first: string; last: string | undefined }
type Params = { first: string; last: string | undefined }

## optional Parameters

Similar to last time, adding a ? will mark last as optional:
``` javascript
export const getName = (first: string, last?: string) => {
```
There is a caveats, however.

You can't put the optional argument before the required one:

// this will not work! export const getName = (last?: string, first: string) => {
// this will not work! export const getName = (last?: string, first: string) => {
This would result in "Required parameter cannot follow an optional parameter".

As before, you could use last: string | undefined but you would then have to pass undefined as the second argument.

## Assigning Types to Variables

By adding : User to defaultUser, we're telling TypeScript that we want it to conform to our User interface.
```Typescript
const defaultUser: User = {}
```
Now TypeScript will display errors at the line where defaultUser is declared.

We also benefit from autocompletion for the properties!

The same : Type syntax can be used with other types, including numbers and functions:

```Typescript
let a: number = 1
```

As you write TypeScript, you need to think about where you want your contracts to be, and what needs to be done in order to meet them.

## Constraining Value Types

The solution is to update role to be a Union type.

The syntax uses | to delineate the options for which values a key can be:

```Typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  role: "admin" | "user" | "super-admin";
}
```
With this change, removing the // @ts-expect-error line will show us the error message along with autocomplete for the allowed options.

### About Union Types

Anything can be added to a union type. For example, we can make a new SuperAdmin type and add it to the role:

``` Typescript
type SuperAdmin = 'super-admin'

interface User {
  // ...other stuff
  role: "admin" | "user" | SuperAdmin;
}
```

In this example, an object primitive is added, and Prettier reformats the code like so:

``` Typescript
role:
  | "admin"
  | "user"
  | SuperAdmin
  | {
      wow: boolean;
    }
```
Union types are everywhere within TypeScript, and will be used throughout Total TypeScript.

They give your code safety and allow you to be really sure of the types of data flowing through your app.

## Working with Arrays

There are two solutions to this problem.

### Add Square Brackets
The first solution is to add a couple of square brackets to Post:

// inside the User interface posts: Post[];
// inside the User interface
posts: Post[];
Now if we create a posts consts of the type Post[], we'll get autocomplete when we populate the id and title properties:

``` Typescript
const posts: Post[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: 'autocomplete works'
  }
]
```

### Use a Generic Type
The second solution is to use a generic type.

This syntax uses the name of what we want (Array, in this case) followed by angle brackets with the type that will be in the array:

``` typescript
// inside the User interface
posts: Array<Post>
```
The generic types are built into TypeScript without us having to import anything.

We'll be seeing more of them later when we get into Promises, Maps, and other more advanced types.

Which one should you use?
Both options resolve to the same thingâ€“ it's just two different ways of writing it.

I like Post[] for arrays, but I wanted to show the generic type syntax since it comes up later.

## Function Return Type Annotations

In this case we'll add : User since we want to return a User.

Before:

const makeUser = () => {

After:

const makeUser = (): User => {

Specifying the type a function returns will check your code as you write it.

For example, User expects id to be a number. If you pass it a string, TypeScript will show you the error inside of the return object right away.

Notice that if you don't include everything that User expects, the errors all show within the makeUser function where the errors are instead of in the tests at the bottom of the file.

Adding type return annotations allows you to be more strict in ensuring that your function is safe on the inside as well as the outside.

## Typing Promises and Async Requests

There are several solutions here.

Do What TypeScript Suggests
In the starting point of the code, hovering over the error message in VS Code pops up a message:

The return type of an async function or method must be the global Promise<T> type. Did you mean to write 'Promise<LukeSkywalker>'?

We get this error because the fetchLukeSkywalker function is async, so the type returned will be a Promise.

Following TypeScript's suggestion to write Promise<LukeSkywalker> will fix this error:

export const fetchLukeSkywalker = async (): Promise<LukeSkywalker> => {

Note that this syntax is similar to the Array<Post> syntax we saw earlier. But unlike arrays, there's only one way to use Promise<T>.

This solution works well, and is probably what I'd recommend.

Type the Fetched Data Response
By default, the data returned from a fetch request will be typed as Any.

Even though we know from the API what our response will contain, TypeScript has no idea. That means that the Any type doesn't give us any autocomplete when we use it.


export const fetchLukeSkywalker = async () => {
  // `data` will be typed as `Any`
  const data = await fetch(

But because we've awaited the fetch, we can type data as LukeSkywalker:

const data: LukeSkywalker = await fetch(

This would give us the autocomplete because it's been properly typed.

Now when we hover over the fetchLukeSkywalker function declaration, we can see that TypeScript has inferred the return type of the function to be Promise<LukeSkywalker> just like we saw in the prior solution.

Cast Data as a Type
In the cases we've looked at so far, we're kind of lying to ourselves a little bit.

TypeScript doesn't know what we're going to return, so we have to tell it. But really, we don't know what the result of our fetch is going to be.

This is where this soltion comes in:

export const fetchLukeSkywalker = async () => {
  const data = await fetch("<https://swapi.dev/api/people/1>").then((res) => {
    return res.json();
  });

  // cast the data to LukeSkywalker
  return data as LukeSkywalker;
};
The return data as LukeSkywalker line casts the fetch response to our LukeSkywalker type.

When working with fetch requests, you should either cast the return data as a type or assign a type to the data when the request is made.

More About Casting
Casting allows us to let anyone become LukeSkywalker:

const matt = {} as LukeSkywalker

Compare the above to if we said matt was assignable to LukeSkywalker:

const matt: LukeSkywalker = {}

This would give us errors because the object doesn't include the appropriate properties. Generally speaking, the assigning syntax is safer than the as syntax, and is probably what you should do in most cases.

## Passing type arguments

We can pass in a type argument to the Set to tell it what type it should be:


const guitarists = new Set<string>();
When the argument is in place, we can only add items of that specific type.

This also enables useful things like hovering over guitarists.add() and seeing that it expects a string.

Digging Deeper
You can pass in type arguments as well as function arguments to certain functions.

In this case since Set is a class that we're instantiating, we can command-click or right-click and say "Go to Definition".

Double-clicking takes us to a file called lib.es2015.collection.d.ts which is where certain parts of JavaScript are typed out.

There's an interface for Set that starts like this:


interface Set<T> {
That T represents the type argument.

Back in our solution code, if you erase the type argument and go back to just Set(), hovering over it will show you that it is typed as Set<unknown>.

Lots of JavaScript constructs and popular libraries use this.

Another Example
Let's create a new Map and pass string as a type argument:


const map = new Map<string>()
Now when we hover, we see the following:


Map<any, any>
This is because Map accepts two type arguments: the first is the key, and the second is the value.

If we wanted to create a map where the keys and values were both strings, it would look like this:

const map = new Map<string, string>() map.set('someKey', 'someValue')

Changing someKey to a number would now give us an error.

This concept of passing type arguments to certain functions and constructors and classes is crucial for understanding TypeScript as a whole!

## Assigning Dynamic Keys to an Object

Use the Record Utility Type
One solution is to type cache as a Record:

const cache: Record<string, string> = {}

The first type argument to Record is for the key, and the second is for the value. In our case, both are strings.

The Record type allows us to add any number of dynamic keys to the object at runtime, using something like this:

cache['keyHere'] = 'valueHere'

Record is different than the Set and Map we looked at earlierâ€“ it is only at the type level.

Use an Index Signature
Here's another way to update cache to please TypeScript:

Recall that in the "before" code we had lots of errors like "You can't use that to index this".

These errors were saying that they couldn't tell what types the key was. Whenever you see an error about an index, it's usually about an object key!

For this fix, we'll add what is called an index signature to our cache:


const cache: {
  [id: string]: string;
} = {};

Index signatures put the name of the index and its type (string or number) inside of square brackets.

So from the above, we can see that id is the index for cache.

If we were to set it to [id: number]: string, every time we called cache.add() we would have to pass a number as the first argument.

Use an Interface with an Index Signature

We can also create an interface for Cache that contains the index signature:

interface Cache {
  [id: string]: string;
}

Then inside of the createCache function we would type cache as Cache:

const createCache = () => {
  const cache: Cache = {};

This would work with a type instead of interface as well.

Which One to Use?

All of these solutions are fine-- there's no pros or cons between them.

I find that the Record syntax is a bit easier to look at and parse what it's doing. It also displays helpful information when you hover over it.

Assigning dynamic keys to an object is a common pattern in JavaScript, and these techniques allow you to do it.

## Narrowing Down Union Types


Inside of the coerceAmount function we can check if amount.amount exists, then return it. Otherwise, return amount:

const coerceAmount = (amount: number | { amount: number }) => {
  if (amount.amount) {
    return amount.amount;
  }
  return amount;
};

Now our tests will pass, but TypeScript gives us an error.

Hovering over amount.amount tells us:

Property 'amount' does not exist on type number.

This is a TypeScript quirk where you can't access a property unless you know it's there.

Check Amount's Type
One way to fix the type error is updating our if to check if the typeof amount is an object. If so, return amount.amount otherwise just return amount.

const coerceAmount = (amount: number | { amount: number }) => {
  if (typeof amount === 'object') {
    return amount.amount;
  }
  return amount;
};

This would also work by checking if typeof amount is number, then return the amount. Otherwise, return amount.amount:

const coerceAmount = (amount: number | { amount: number }) => {
  if (typeof amount === 'number') {
    return amount;
  }
  return amount.amount;
};
Using the typeof operator to narrow down different branches of a union type is really powerful technique.

It's also really useful when interfacing with APIs that you didn't create.

## Typing Errors in a Try-Catch

Use Any Type
One way to solve this challenge is to type e in the catch as any:


} catch (e: any) {
  return e.message;
}

We can use any because we're pretty confident that the error is going to be an error.

What makes this solution not ideal is that we lose autocomplete on the e. This makes it easy to end up with typos that can cause issues later.

This isn't the solution I would suggest.

Coerce as Error
A slightly better solution would be to coerce e to be an Error, and return the message:

} catch (e) {
  return (e as Error).message;
}

Here e is still unknown when we enter the catch, but using as coerces it to an Error and we get our autocomplete as expected.

This solution is about as unsafe as the one above - we're not checking if e is an Error, we're casting it as an error.

Check with instanceof
This solution is pretty similar to the last, except this time we'll use instanceof to see if e is an Error:

} catch (e) { if (e instanceof Error) { return e.message; } }

} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof Error) {
    return e.message;
  }
}
Unlike previous solutions, this time we're checking e at runtime to whittle down what it could be.

We're not blanketing it with the any type and we're not casting it to something else either.

This is my recommended solution, because it's the safest.

If you get something that isn't an error, it will fall down to the next block where you could do something else with it.

However, depending on the constraints of your codebase and how much you care about avoiding anys, you may prefer one of the other solutions.

## Inheriting Interface Properties

The first thing to do is create a new Base interface with the id property:

interface Base {
  id: string;
}

With that in place, we can use the extends keyword with each of the other interfaces and remove the id:


interface User extends Base {
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
}

interface Post extends Base {
  title: string;
  body: string;
}

interface Comment extends Base {
  comment: string;
}

Adding extends Base makes it so the types inherit the properties of the Base interface.

Note that if the User, Post, and Comment were defined using the type keyword, we would not be able to use extends:

// This won't work!
type Base {
  id: string;
}

// Syntax errors
type Comment extends Base {
  comment: string;
}

This is because extends is a property of interface that type doesn't have.

Interfaces can extend from other interfaces. This allows us to change things in just one place, which is really useful.

It's even possible to extend multiple interfaces.

For example, we can have Post extend from Base and User:

interface Post extends Base, User {
  title: string;
  body: string;
}
Then when creating a new post variable, we would have autocomplete on all of the properties required.

Interfaces can be composed together in a neater way than if we were just using types alone. This is particularly useful for situations where we have a complex data model that you want to express in TypeScript.

## Combining Types to Create New Types

This syntax might look confusing, but it is exactly what we want:

export const getDefaultUserAndPosts = (): User & { posts: Post[] } => {

It says that we want to return a User as well as an array of Posts.

The & tells TypeScript that we want to intersect the two.

This is similar to what we saw with extends previously, but this time instead of inheriting, we are combining.

With extends you inherit, and with & you combine.

So we are making a single return type by combining User with an array of Posts.

It's possible to intersect multiple types, including those we create inline.

For example, we can also add an age:

export const getDefaultUserAndPosts = (): User & { posts: Post[] } & { age: number} => {

If the return type starts to get too messy, you can do the intersection at the type level:


type DefaultUserAndPosts = (): User & { posts: Post[] } & { age: number}

export const getDefaultUserAndPosts = (): DefaultUserAndPosts => {
Now when working with the DefaultUserAndPosts type, we would get autocompletion on all of the required properties.

Intersection is usually used for composing types from other types, but can be useful in other situations as well.

## Selectively Construct Types from Other Types

There are a couple of solutions here that both make use of TypeScript's built-in helpers.

Use Omit
The first solution is to Omit.

According to TypeScript, this constructs a type with the properties of T except for those in type K.

Here's what the syntax looks like:

type MyType = Omit<User, "id">;

What we're saying here is create a type with everything that User has except for id.

Use Pick
The second solution is to use Pick, which is the inverse of Omit:

type MyType = Pick<User, "firstName" | "lastName">;

Here we're taking User and picking its firstName and lastName properties.

Note that Pick provides autocompletion while Omit does not.

This is because you are able to omit keys that aren't present on the original type, which means you end up with all of its properties. This is an advanced problem that we will tackle down the road.

For now, just know that both of Omit and Pick are globally available in TypeScript and are extremely useful tools.



## Typing Functions

You can declare a function type using this syntax:

(isFocused: boolean) => void

The isFocused argument is a boolean, and we're returning void.

This syntax can be used inline like this:

const addListener = (onFocusChange: (isFocused: boolean) => void) => {

Or it can be extracted to its own type like this:

type FocusListener = (isFocused: boolean) => void;

const addListener = (onFocusChange: FocusListener) => {

The Structure of a Function Type
The basic structure starts with the arguments and the return type, both of which can be whatever you want.

You can use undefined for the return type, but then your function has to actually return undefined.

For times when your function has no return value, you should use void.

Using Function types
Here's an example of adding an isGreat boolean as an additional argument:

type FocusListener = (isFocused: boolean, isGreat: boolean) => void;

Then whenever we called the FocusListener we would have to include parameters for both:

const addListener = (onFocusChange: FocusListener) => { onFocusChange(true, true) }

We can also use function types in the same way we're used to using other types. Just be aware that your return types match appropriately.

const myFocusListener = (isFocused: boolean): void => { // TypeScript error that `{}` is unassignable to void return {} }

Most of the time you're not going to need these types unless you're passing functions to other functions, or declaring the type of the function.

## Typing Async Functions

Here's the correct syntax for typing these functions:

const createThenGetUser = async (
  createUser: () => Promise<string>,
  getUser: (id: string) => Promise<User>,
): Promise<User> => {
  const userId: string = await createUser();

  const user = await getUser(userId);

  return user;
};

Same as before, these can be extracted out into their own types as well:

type GetUser = (id: string) => Promise<User>;

What this is saying is that we have an id which is a string, and the function will return a Promise containing a User.

If we had GetUser only returning the User without the Promise, we won't be able to call it as an async function in the test due to errors.

Wrapping function return types with Promises is really useful when working with real world processes like fetching from databases.
