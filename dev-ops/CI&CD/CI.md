continuous integration

continusus integration is integrating our changes into the main code and that they work on everyone's machine

continuously merging code into main branch

frequently commit your code to the main branch

process:

make small changes, check the changes in our machine,

you need a CI server to check code changes and builds and run tests and takes the result and reports back to the dev team to red light or green light the merge of code into main

everytime you git pull you know you're getting working code

you could add a code linter for formatting issues or automated security tests

circl.ci - travis ci - github ci - jenkins ci
