Continuous Delivery

a process that builds on top of CI and CD gives you even more confidence in code that code will work in production environments

Each time we add code to main branch - it is ready to be delivered and deployed to production

run acceptance tests to ensure app does what it says it does by QA engineers

lowers the risk of a big launch

you can scheudle these tests to beta release and users
