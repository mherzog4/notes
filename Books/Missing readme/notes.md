# Chapter 1: The Journey ahead

This book consolidates key information that you need to be successful

but what does a successful software engineer look like and how do you get there?

## Your destination

Everyone begins as a entry-level engineer - to advance youll need to be compotent in several core areas

### Technical Knowledge

You know computer science fundamentals

you know how to use integrated development envuroments, build systems, debuggers, and test frameworks

you proactively create and improve test code

you consider operations when making architectural decisions

### Execution

You create value by solving problems with code, and you understand the connection between your work and the busienss

you've build and deployed small and medium size features

you write, test, and review code

you are proactive and dependable - you particicpate in technical talks, reading groups, interviews and presentations

### Communication

You communicate clearly both in written and verbal form

you are able to give and receive feedback effectively

You proactively ask for help and get clarification in ambigious situations

you raise sissues and identify probelsm in a constructive manner

you provide help when possible and are starting to influence peers

you document you work

you write clear design documents and invite feedback 

you are patient and empathetic when dealing with others

### Leadership

You work independtly on well-scoped work 

you learn from mistakes quickly

you handle change and ambiguity well

you actively participate in project and quartely planning

you help new team members onboard

you give meaningful feedback to you manager

## A map for your journey

Get familiar with the company, the team and how things get done

attend onboarding meetins, set up your development environment and system access and figure out regular team processes and meetings

read documentation and have discussions with teammates

contribute by filling in documentation gaps you find in the onboarding processes

if you company doesnt have a new hire program, ask your manager to explain the org chart, the different deparments and how they relate & take notes

Some companies have additional new software engineer onboarding processes ot help you get access to systems and set up your development environment and check otu and build code - if no such process exists, you have an opportunity to create one

You should get assigned a small taks to learn the basics of makign a code change and shepherding it inot production

if not, look or ask for some useful-but-minor change to make 

it can be as small as updating a comment; the goal is to understand the steps, not to impress

set up your code editor or IDE - use the IDE that your team uses & configure your IDE to apply team code formatting conventions

Make sure your manager adds you yo team and company meetings-standups, sprint planning, retrospectives, all-hand and so on

remind your manger to scheudle a one-on-one metting if they conduct them

### Cunningham's law and bike-shedding

we advise you yo document conventions, onboarding procures, and other oral traditions on your team

you will get alot of comments and corrections 

the point is not to write a perfect doc but rather to write enough to trigger a discussion that fleshes out the details

this is cunningham's law which states that "the best way to get the right answer on the internet is not to ask a questions; its to post the wrong answer

Be prepared for trivial discussions to become drawn out, a phenomeno called bike shedding

bike-shedding describes a committee assigned to review designs for a power plant - the committee approves the plans within minutes as they are too complex to actually discuss

they then spend 45 minutes discussing the materials for the bike shed next to the plant - bike-shedding comes up a lot in technical work

## Ramp up river

Once you've completed newbie tasks, you'll take on your first real work for the team - you will probably work on an existing codebase

ask questions and have your team review your work frequently

Learning is critical as your ramp up - investigate how code is build, tested, and deployed

read pull requests and code reviews

dont be afriad to ask for more information

sign up for tech talks, brown bags, reading groups, mentorship programs and the like

now is the time to build a relationship with your manager

get to know their working style, understand their expectations and talk to thme about your goals

if your manager does one-on-ones expect to have your first few sessions 

managers usually want to track progress so ask your manager how to communicate status

you'll probably also attend your first planning session, usually a sprint planning meeting

you might also join retrospective or allhands meetings

ask for an overview of the roadmap and development planning process
