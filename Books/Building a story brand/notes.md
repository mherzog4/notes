# Building a story brand notes

## Chapter 1: The key to being seen, heard, and understood

The fact is, pretty websites don't sell things, words sell things

and if we haven't clarified our message, our customers wont listen

### Why so many business fail

The more simple and predictable the communication, the easier it is for the brain to digest

stroy helps because it is a sense-making mechanism

essentially, story formulas put everything in order so the brain doenst have to work to understand what's going on

Without us knowing it, human beings are constantly scanning their environment (even advertising) for information that is going to help them meet their primitive need to survive

### Mistake number one

The first mistake brands make is they fail to focus on the aspects of their offer that will help people survive and thrive

This means that if we position our products and services as anything but an aid in helping people survive, thrive, be accepted, find love, achieve an aspirational identity, or bond with a tribe that will defend them phsyically and socially, good luck selling anything to anybody

### Mistake number 2

The second mistake brands make is they cuse their customer to burn too many calories in an effort to understand their offer

### The key is clarity

in a story, audienes must always know who the hero is, waht the hero wants , who the hero has to defate to get what they want, what trafic thing will heppen if the hero doesnt win, etc

the same is true for the brand your represent

our customers have questions burining inside them and if we arent answering those questions theyll move on to another brand

if we havent identified what our customer wants what problem we are helping them solve and life will look like they engage our products and services

### Business has an enemy

The enemy im talking about is nise

nise has killed more ideas, rpducts, and services than anything

im talking about the noise we create as a business

what we often call marketing is really just clutter and confussion sprayed all over our websites, e-mails, and commercials - and its costing us millions

What we think we are saying to our customers and what our customers actually hear are two different things

and customers make buying decisions not based on what we say but on what they hear

### Stop saying that

All experienced writes know the key to great writing isnt in what they say; its in what they dont say

## Chapter 2: The secret weapon that will grow your business
