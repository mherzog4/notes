# Intro

Positioning is the act of deliberately defining how you are the best at something that a defined market cares a lot about

If we fail at positioning we fail at mareketing and sales - if we fail at marketing and sales the entire business fails

The first step to optimizing positioning is to really understand what it is - i like to describe positoning as "context setting" for products

weak positiong leaves a trail- the signs are there if you know where too look

- your current customers love you but new prospects cant figure out what you're selling

If your prospects cant figure out what you do-quickly- they will invent a position for you one that potentially hides your key strenghts or misrepresents your value

when you dont own your positioning you are putting your compnay at a competitive disadvantage

talk to people and show them your product and explain what it does

now ask them how they would describe what you do - likewise ask exisitng cusotmers about your offering and see what they say

- Your company has long sales cycles and low close rates and you're losing out to the competition

Products with a strong position make their vlue obvious, attract suitable customers and sell quickly

Effective positioning makes your sales efforts more efficent by attracting customers who are a great fit and who move through a buying process quickly

- You have high customer churn

customers who misunderstood your value chose your for the wrong reasons and now they're trying to recover sunk costs by turning your porduct into what they thought they were getting

- you're under price pressure

You cant charge a premium for a product that seems exactly lilke everything else on the market and weakly positioned products are seen to offer little beyond their competitors

## Chapter 1: What is positioning - positioning as context

Context enables people to figure out what is important

positiong products is a lot like context setting in the opening of a movie
